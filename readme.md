   In this project we will be using a 
   - Python based web framework called web2py for building APIs  
   - VueJS for building reactive HTML front-end.

#### web2py

Web2py is an open-source web application framework written in the Python programming language. Web2py allows web developers to program dynamic web content using Python [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web2py)


#### VueJS

Vue.js is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members[More info](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)


 ### A quick note on some important folders / files:
  - All your web2py apps/projects are contained in this directory.
  - web2py.py: We can start our web server by running this script:
    
            - cd Downloads/web2py_src
            - python web2py.py


#### Web2py inherently supports MVC (Model View Controller) architecture.

   - Models: define database schema and validations
   - Views: hosts your HTML code
   - Controllers: Python code where you will write business logic and manages interactions between front-end and the database.

#### Posters 

Posters.zip contains posters for each movie in the MovieLens dataset, filename corresponds to the ‘movieId’. It is open-sourced at: https://github.com/babu-thomas/movielens-posters

     movies.json & movies_small.json contain list of dictionaries, containing ‘movieId’, ‘title’, ‘genres’.
